# GTK3 application to display lichess live feed [WIP]

The aim of this project is to make a chess application in C that will pop onto screen once a move is played.  I'm making this ahead of the upcoming World Chess Championship so that while I'm busy doing my work, I'll be updated every now and then when a move is played. Currently this program can show live lichess TV feed, which is nice.
